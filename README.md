# EnsembleLearning-Techniques

Ensemble Learning is a powerful technique where multiple machine learning models are combined to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions. In this demo, I will be using the Random Forest algorithm as the base model for the ensemble.

Here are the steps we will follow:

1. Load the dataset
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
3. Train the Random Forest model on the training data
4. Evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model on the testing data
5. Implement Ensemble Learning by training multiple instances of the Random Forest model on different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions on the testing data
6. Evaluate the performance of the Ensemble model on the testing data and compare it with the performance of the Random Forest model
